//Think of a variable as a container. Cup analogies work well. 
//They store info. We can pour liquid into a cup and change its value.
// We can pour two half cups into another cup. We can pour one cup into a bigger cup.

var x; //declares a variable named x
x = 5; //initializes the variable
console.log(x + 4);
//you can change the value of a variable 
x = 6;
console.log(x + 4);

//const assigns a permanent value to a variable, you can not change the value
const feetInMile = 5280;
console.log(feetInMile);

//variable names should be descriptive//Camel Casing
var ageOfMyOldestFerret = 40;
var numberOfEggsInOneSitting = 50;
var firstName = "Alayna";

// you can do math with variables
var age = 18;
var ageInAugust = age + 1;
console.log(ageInAugust);

var eleven = 11;
console.log(eleven * eleven);

var seventeen = 17;
